# huge-rss-list

I was looking for the biggest list of RSS URLs that I could find, but couldn't find a very large data set. I assembled a larger list than I could find elsewhere by listening to the Bluesky jetstream (firehose) for every post that contained a URL. For each unique domain, I retrieved one URL from that domain and looked for an RSS/Atom URL in its meta tags.

This list is curated in the sense that only URLs that are recently active are included, but completely uncurated with regards to content.

Fields:
* url
* title
* subtitle
* site_href
* timestamp of most recent successful retrieval
* timestamp of most recent published article
